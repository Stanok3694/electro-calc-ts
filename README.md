This project is another implementation of ElectricityPayment Calculator (see there -> https://github.com/Stanok3694/electro-calc)
***
Used TypeScript, React for UI and Jest for unit-tests.
***
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Any tech information about this template you can find in file Another.Readme.md
***
I have implemented the logic of payment calculations and covered this by unit-tests on Jest.
***
*TODO*:
 - change UI implementation and cover this by unit-tests;
 - implement mobile view settings for more UX;
 - use some e2e for coverage user actions scenarios.
